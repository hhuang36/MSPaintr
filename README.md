## Project Description:

MSPaintr is a unique social media platform designed for Microsoft Paint artists to share their beautiful works of art. 

Users must make an account to follow other artists and share their own work. Upon a user’s first visit to the website, they will be prompted to either login with an existing account or register for one. After registration, users can login with their credentials to view their news feed.

When a user registers for an account, a new user profile is made. The user profile displays the user’s profile picture, a brief bio, and a view of their most current MS Paint posts. Under the user’s profile picture, there is a follow icon (a sheep) and a message icon (an envelope). These icons allow users to follow and message other users, respectively. A user’s follower count is not displayed, as the number of followers one has should not matter.

The news feed will consist of MS Paint artwork shared by artists a user follows. Users can feel free to like (“star”) and comment on shared posts. The number of likes will not be displayed; only a “+1” will be displayed to let the user know they liked a certain post. A user can like and comment on their own posts. A user’s username will be displayed next to their comment. To see all the comments on a post, the user can click the “See more” button near the bottom of the post. The user will be brought to a new page displaying the post with full-sized artwork and all comments. 

Users can share their own artwork by clicking the “New Post” link on the left side of the screen. Clicking “New Post” brings up a pop-up that allows users to make a new post. Only PNG files can be uploaded for the post. No description for the post is necessary, as art speaks for itself.

Users can message each other through MSPaintr’s own chat engine. To message another user, users must visit the recipient’s user profile and click the message icon (an envelope). Users will be redirected to a new chat page so they can send messages to the recipient.
